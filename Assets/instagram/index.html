		<h2> <strong>Professor or Professional Visit</strong></h1> 
	     <h3> Visit the Help Center on August 25,2021</h2>
		On August 25, 2021, I visited the Help Center and spoke to Fred about becoming a Robotics Software Developer.
I enjoy the meeting, as he was very helpful in recommending clubs, I should participate in such as the cybersecurity club or joining a boot camp- to learn various back-end or front-end programming language.
Nevertheless, he recommend two professor class I must take for programming which are Roger Webster and Melinda Lynys. Furthermore we talk about how one semicolon can ruining someone life when coding!<br><br>

		<h2>Workshop #2-Be the Change Workshop- September 22,2021</h1>
			<h3>Be the Change Workshop with Linda Johnsen</h3>
	On Wednesday I attend a workshop about change. I learn how change occur and how I can start movement about anything I am passionate about. However, in order to start I must research about my topic from reliable and crediable source. I must talk to someone and be willing to see if they would like to know more a topic. If they say no, I should not take that a failure but a reflectin to see where I went wrong so that I will be able to to better myself as a advocate. <br> <br>

	I had finally met my advisor and put a face to the voice I had heard prior to weeks before. We discuss steps in going further as well as taking all my spring courses and prequiste course by the end of first year. We also complete a degree map to ensure I will be graduting with both of my degrees by the end of my three year tenor. As well as class I will be required to take to ensure they are transferrable and all my college credit will be accounted for. With both of my degrees I will be able to transfer to FSU or FGCU at the junior level. My advisor is the best!<br><br>

	<h1>Accademic Support Center- Math and Writing</h1>
    <h2>On Monday, August 30,2021 I visit both centers.</h2> 
    
    Writing Center:
      On Monday, I visit the writing center and Alisha gave me tips and tricks on how to concise my writing and organizing my thoughts as well how to properly cite my sources. She taught me my favorite quote was not only a quote but its from a poem too. I would like to thank all the amazing persons who work at the writing center for their assistance in helping me grow as a person as well developing my writing skills.

    Math Center:
     In the math center, I met Eva who I am now good friends with. I go to the math center immediately after my Algebra class to study and complete my math assignments. They also provide study sheets, worksheets and material to assist in any math topic. I find going to the math center is therapeutic I do not know to explain it.

	<h1>OBOC Event- August 31,2021 </h1>
		<h3>One book One College Launch</h3>
		The launch of the One Book, One College began on Tuesday with a Sustainability Fair, <br> a plant-based food sampling and a dicsusion abut the book A Life on Our Planet by Davis Attebborough.<br> At the Sustaibailuty Fair we learn about some of the various club the school offer such as book club and sustainabily club. <br> I was intriguded by the Opossum that the CROW (Clinic for the Rehabition of Wildlife) representative had. This is my first time seeing one in real life.<br> I learn from the ECHO orgaization that I can purify water by taking some Moringa Seeds and crushed it with a mortar, <br> stir it into the water and let it sit for a few hours.<br> The imputities will settle to the bottom and the top will contain the clean water.<br> 
 		Click here to see a youtube video on water purfication <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hZ5ixwcKno&ab_channel=DavidEnge" target="_blank"> Water Purfication</a>

		Additionally, They have a farm tour which contains Ackee which is poisnous plant <br> if not handle properly but it is my favourite food.<br>

			<h4>Part Two</h4>

				I attend the discusion aspect of the day by going to a presentation by Micheal Suey. I learn that the voice I know but never seen a face was indeed Davis Attebborough. From the discusion I come to a relization that if I want a future legacy then I must start with me. I can start by reducing my meat intake as well start a hydrophonic garden. This event encourges students to read the book by telling us we are not savig our planets but we are saving ourselves. For my professional studies this motivates me to do better in school so that one that I can develop a software programme to help reduce global warming by either watering plants or help migrate organisms when the temputure is getting higher/lower than usually.
